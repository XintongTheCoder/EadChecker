## Motivation

Special thanks to USCIS who made this project possible.

Far before my Employment Autorization Document (EAD) expirion date, I sent out the extension request. The fear of losing my job as a Tesla mechanical engineer was eating me as the expiration date approached. So I hoped I could find a way to not check the disappointing status everyday but still be able to be notified when there was an update.

I picked up Java 101 and started the first line of this project. Things aren't going the right way I had expected. I lost the job after 2 month of the expiration date when USCIS still hadn't processed my extension request. My 20k year end bonus was gone, too. When God closes a door, he opens a window. I found out progarmming is awesome!

Gradually, I learnt how to fire http requests, use git, play with string, use HTML parser, serialize and deserialize objects, use gradle as build tool, pack code in a docker. A new world opens its door to me. I no longer wish to be a Tesla mechanical engineer. I want to do more coding!

## Getting Started

Here is a guideline to help you get started to use this EAD-checker.

To run the program, there are two arguments needed: your EAD application receipt number and the number of cases you would like to track. For instance:

'WAC2190088xxx 300'

will track from 150 cases before to 150 cases after your case.

The project only quries public data. No PII will be involved.
